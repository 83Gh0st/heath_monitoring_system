## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need:

- **Hardware**:
  - Arduino Uno (or compatible microcontroller)
  - Pulse sensor
  - Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35)
  - LCD (16x2) with I2C module
  - Connecting wires, resistors, and a breadboard
- **Software**:
  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  - TimerOne Library (provided in the repository)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/83Gh0st/health_monitoring_system.git
   cd health_monitoring_system
   ```

2. **Install the Arduino IDE** (if not already installed).

3. **Import the TimerOne Library**:

   - Locate the `TimerOne-1.1.0.zip` file in the repository.
   - Open the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**, and import `TimerOne-1.1.0.zip`.

4. **Open the Code**:

   Open the file `Patient_Health_Monitoring_Code.ino` in the Arduino IDE.

### Circuit Diagram

The project includes a Proteus design file (`Patient Health Monitoring Circuit.DSN`) for a detailed circuit layout. Use Proteus (or any compatible software) to view or simulate the design. Below is a high-level description of connections:

- **Pulse Sensor**:
  - Connect the sensor's signal pin to an analog pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).
- **Temperature Sensor (LM35)**:
  - Connect the analog output to another analog pin (e.g., A1).
- **LCD (16x2)**:
  - Connect the I2C pins (SDA, SCL) to the corresponding pins on the Arduino (e.g., A4, A5).
- **Power and Ground**:
  - Ensure proper connections to the Arduino’s 5V and GND pins.

### Uploading the Code

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
2. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port under **Tools**.
3. Upload the code (`Patient_Health_Monitoring_Code.ino`) to the board.

---

## Usage

1. **Power On**:
   - Connect the Arduino to a power source (USB or battery).
   - Ensure sensors and LCD are connected as per the circuit diagram.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - View real-time readings on the LCD.
   - Observe changes in health parameters dynamically.

## Customization

- **Add More Sensors**:
  Extend the project by integrating additional sensors like:
  - Blood pressure sensor
  - SpO2 sensor
  - Humidity sensor
- **IoT Integration**:
  - Use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules (e.g., ESP8266 or HC-05) to send data to a cloud or mobile app.

## Deployment

The system is ideal for:

- **Educational Projects**: Demonstrate health monitoring principles.
- **Prototyping**: Build a foundation for advanced IoT health devices.
- **Personal Use**: Monitor health parameters at home.
